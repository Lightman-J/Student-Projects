Project Examples

+ BMI Calculator: This Matlab app utilizes standard height and weight data to compute the BMI. 
+ Kinematics Graph: This Matlab application plots the acceletation, velocity and displacement on a graph given the right variables.
+ TicTacToe: This MatLab application is a two player TicTacToe game.
+ Unit Converter: There are two different unit converter applications which take input in English units and output the equivalent standard SI units and vice versa. 
+ Spot the Difference: This application is a game where a user can spot the difference between images.
+ Vector Decomposition: This Matlab application plots the coordinates and magnitudes of vectors.
+ Whackamole: This Matlab application is a timed game to whack as many moles in the given time phrame. 

These are samples of projects done in this class with varying levels of complexity based on student proficiency with MatLab.
